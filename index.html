        <h2>Welcome to Crop Disease Detection Using CNNs and Federated Learning</h2>

        <p>
            Crop disease detection and management is a critical aspect of modern agriculture, where data science and machine learning provide valuable decision-making tools. 
            This project focuses on leveraging <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> and <strong>Federated Learning (FL)</strong> to create a robust system for detecting crop diseases from images.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the rise of <strong>precision agriculture</strong>, farmers are increasingly using modern technologies to enhance productivity, minimize environmental impact, 
            and reduce reliance on harmful pesticides. One of the key challenges is the early detection of diseases in crops, which can lead to significant economic losses and lower yields if not addressed. 
            This project aims to tackle that challenge by using cutting-edge deep learning techniques and ensuring data privacy through federated learning.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Highlights of This Project:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>: We utilize CNNs and Vision Transformers to detect anomalies in crop images, ensuring timely intervention and treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Federated Learning</strong>: By allowing decentralized training, federated learning ensures that data privacy and security are preserved, making it a scalable solution even for rural and remote areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision Agriculture</strong>: Enhances crop quality, minimizes the use of harmful chemicals, and optimizes yields through targeted interventions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Federated Learning?</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional machine learning techniques rely on centralized data collection, which poses risks to data privacy, security, and increases computational costs. Federated learning overcomes these challenges by enabling multiple devices or entities (like farmers) to collaborate in model training without sharing their data. This ensures:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data privacy and security:</strong> Compliant with data regulations such as GDPR.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Allows training models in decentralized environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Reduces the cost of transferring large datasets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p>
            This project evaluated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and modern attention-based models such as <strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs)</strong> using <strong>federated learning</strong> on open-source image datasets from the <strong>PlantVillage platform</strong>. 
            The objective was to ensure that these models maintain high accuracy while respecting the privacy and sensitivity of user data.
