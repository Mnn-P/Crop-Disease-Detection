        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The study investigates the application of federated learning (FL) in crop disease detection, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). 
            We utilize the PlantVillage dataset to train models that detect crop diseases in various plant leaves, preserving user data privacy and security. This paper evaluates the 
            effectiveness of FL in improving model accuracy while ensuring that sensitive agricultural data remains secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our results show that ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformers offer significant potential in the FL paradigm, with a notable trade-off between computational 
            cost and model performance across various crops. Federated learning emerges as a promising method for enhancing crop disease classification while addressing privacy concerns.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, leading to reduced crop yields and significant economic losses. 
            Early detection of plant diseases can mitigate these effects, but traditional methods often rely on manual inspection, which is labor-intensive 
            and prone to error. With advances in machine learning, particularly in deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), automated 
            systems for disease detection have emerged as viable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, a major challenge in deploying machine learning models for agriculture is data privacy. Federated Learning (FL) offers a way to 
            overcome this challenge by allowing multiple entities to collaborate and train models without sharing sensitive data. This research explores 
            the effectiveness of FL in crop disease detection using CNNs and Vision Transformers.
